## How to play
Players are given the ability to control a character across the field using the arrow keys - up, down, left, and right. The aim of the game is to cross to the end of the field as many times as possible without colliding with enemies.

* Each successful cross is worth 1 point.
* The game ends once a player collides with an enemy.
